## Practice for 2022 Coding Interviews

### Order: 
BFS -> DFS -> BT/BST -> Heap -> Hashmap/set -> String-> Linked List -> Stack/Queue -> Sorting -> Recursion -> String -> Bit -> Backtracking -> Greedy -> DP -> Trie -> System Design/OOD

### Preparation
- 2 weeks to brush up on Python - Data Structures stuff (BFS, DFS, Trie, PriorityQueue, QuickSort, MergeSort are high priority)
https://github.com/OmkarPathak/Data-Structures-using-Python
- Cracking the Coding Interview
- Textbook for Data Structures and Algorithms. Take some notes and build a personal repo with solutions. 
- Related practices on Leetcode within FB’s questions.
- Coursera Algo and DS courses (Princeton, Stanford)

### Tips
Focus on the breadth of questions, and practice 3+ times for each question to the point that you can have the solution after 5 seconds.

Practice by companies - Facebook’s questions (Get a leetcode premium), categorize by practicing each topic, start by medium questions, then hard and easy questions. Do 300 questions. 

If medium questions can’t be answered in 5 minutes, go to solutions. Understand the solutions, practice multiple times. 
Construct a repo for yourself for all the questions you practice, and comment your solutions and intuition. 
3-6 questions per day. (3+ hours）
