## Practice for 2022 Coding Interviews

### Order:

BFS -> DFS -> BT/BST -> Heap -> Hashmap/set -> String-> Linked List -> Stack/Queue -> Sorting -> Recursion -> String -> Bit -> Backtracking -> Greedy -> DP -> Trie -> System Design/OOD

### Preparation

- 2 weeks to brush up on Python - Data Structures stuff (BFS, DFS, Trie, PriorityQueue, QuickSort, MergeSort are high priority)
  https://github.com/OmkarPathak/Data-Structures-using-Python
- Cracking the Coding Interview
- Intro to Algorithms
- Textbook for Data Structures and Algorithms. Take some notes and build a personal repo with solutions.
- Blind 75
- Coursera Algo and DS courses (Princeton, Stanford)

### Tips

Focus on the breadth of questions, and practice 3+ times for each question to the point that you can have the solution after 5 seconds.

Practice by companies - Facebook’s questions (Get a leetcode premium), categorize by practicing each topic, start by medium questions, then hard and easy questions. Do 300 questions.

If medium questions can’t be answered in 5 minutes, go to solutions. Understand the solutions, practice multiple times.
Construct a repo for yourself for all the questions you practice, and comment your solutions and intuition.
3-6 questions per day. (3+ hours）
